## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

# Installation Instruction

## Steps to Clone and Set Up the Project:
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone your Laravel project. Then, run the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/nj-ramadhan/sikohim_unikom.git`


## Navigate to the Project Directory:
Change into the project directory using the following command:

`cd <project-directory>`
Replace <project-directory> with the name of your project directory.


## Install Composer Dependencies:
Laravel uses Composer to manage its dependencies. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

`composer install`


## Create a Copy of the Environment File:
Laravel requires an .env file for configuration. Create a copy of the .env.example file and name it .env:

`cp .env.example .env`
Edit the .env file to set up your database connection and other configuration settings.


## Generate Application Key:
Run the following command to generate the application key:

`php artisan key:generate`
Update Your Database Credentials
After that update your database credentials in your .env file in your project root.

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=#your database password
```

## Migrate Database:
Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables in your database:

`php artisan migrate`


## Link Storage:
Link storage:

`php artisan storage:link`

## Serve the Application:
Finally, you can use the following command to start the Laravel development server:

`php artisan serve`

This will make your application accessible at http://localhost:8000 by default.
